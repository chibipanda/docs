# ChibiPanda: An Owner's Manual

Congratulations on your acquaintance with the ChibiPanda unit. You shall have a very weird time ahead of you. 

## Introduction

This manual is intended to familiarise you with the ChibiPanda unit. The ChibiPanda unit is very particular, with certain likes and dislikes, and peculiar habits. We have tried to make all the information in this User Manual easy to find. Should you like to find a quick overview of the ChibiPanda unit, please refer to the At A Glance section.  

Should you have any question not answered by this user manual, please refer to the ChibiPanda unit. Information on specific point of view can also be found on the Internet. 

## At A Glance

The ChibiPanda unit occurs naturally in urban settings. Occurrence in rural settings is not impossible, but it will feel out of place and bored unless the boredom is mitigated by books, movies, and/or interesting people. While the ChibiPanda unit is easily amused, it is also easily bored. 

The ChibiPanda unit by nature is quite solitary, therefore, it is sometimes interacting with great awkwardness. The ChibiPanda unit’s experience is quite limited, and therefore, will mostly be able to speak with credibility only in those areas it is experienced in. The ChibiPanda unit does not read intent very well, and does not understand body language very well. 

The ChibiPanda unit in general does not make too much assumptions. It also has weird thoughts from time to time, things that are very trivial to normal people. The ChibiPanda unit is not good at all with feelings, and this includes its own feeling. In case of psychological irritation detection followed with “I don’t know” after being asked, it is best to leave it alone until the ChibiPanda unit figures out what is happening, and it will report back with possible cause, and propose a fix for the issue, likely, with a measurable success criteria.

While feelings are generally a black box to your ChibiPanda unit, facts and logics are largely fascinating. The ChibiPanda unit is fond of learning and understanding. It loves mathematics, quantum physics, and in general, science. It is not to say that it’s particularly good at them. When presented with a problem, the ChibiPanda unit will look at it as a puzzle and endeavour to solve it. It is also particularly fond of looking things up to get fact accurately. It shall strive to not make guesses, even educated one, but will try when asked to.

The ChibiPanda unit is a chocolate fiend with no tolerance to alcohol. Aside from chocolate, it has particular affinity to cheese as well. It loves the combination of chocolate and cheese, and in general finds delights in experimenting with different food combination. Sometimes, these experiments do backfire and causes some gastronomic discomfort, at which point, it is advised to just leave the ChibiPanda unit alone until discomfort abated.

The ChibiPanda unit has keen sense of smell, therefore, strong perfumes are emphatically discouraged, and it is appreciated if body odour is kept to minimum. It is also particularly easy to startle, and loud noises scare it. It hates darkness and insects. 

## Parts and Assembly
The ChibiPanda unit shall come fully assembled, and the general parts are in accordance to the general human anatomy. Divided into Regional Group of Human Body, it will come with a head and a neck, upper limbs, thorax, abdomen, back, pelvic and perineum area, and lower limbs. Inside, there will be the usually expected major organ systems: circulatory, digestive, endocannabinoid, endocrine, integumentary, immune, lymphatic, musculoskeletal, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, urinary, and vestibular systems.

Please refer to a copy of general human anatomy book for more detailed information about different parts and parts interactions. 

### Parts

The ChibiPanda unit is a member of the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, and possesses the same general anatomy as the rest of the subspecies. To abbreviate this already lengthy user manual, it is recommended that user consult one of the abundant books on anatomy in the market. 

### Assembly

The ChibiPanda unit comes fully assembled. No general assembly needed. While it is recommended that the ChibiPanda unit be covered in generally accepted covering, the ChibiPanda unit is quite capable of clothing itself. It is also quite capable of picking its own clothing. 

In general, it wears size 4 in American size, jeans size 29x32 in men’s size. The unit prefers clothing that are more simple. It has its own sense of “interesting”, and in general gravitates towards it. The unit pays great attention to cloth texture and feel, and in general prefers softer clothing with decent drape. Since the unit usually is quite rough, it is also preferred that clothing be durable enough to withstand daily use, machine wash, and machine dry. The unit does not like animal print, and hates small dots. Instead, plain almost sedate colours usually are preferred. 

Clothing that does not look too baggy are generally preferred. The unit usually goes for tailored fitted look. There usually are some problems with buying shirts, therefore, a good fitted shirt is always an appreciated find. While the unit prefers to wear jeans with an interesting top, which could range from an interestingly coloured t-shirt to a one-off find blouse, it has been known to also wear tailored dress to work. 

The unit comes with a size 38 feet. Normally, about 3 inches chunky heeled shoes are preferred. However, the unit has been sighted with a 4 inches stilettos in the office paired with shirt and pencil skirt. Boots are generally preferred in the winter, either ankle, or knees. It is required that winter boots have rubber soles and chunky heels to help with traction and stability. 

The unit usually wears simple jewellery along with the rest of the outfit. It prefers a short necklace with an understated pendant as the focal point, and a pair of earrings. Efforts are usually made to match the earrings and the necklace as much as possible. However, it does not always perfectly work. The unit is quite lazy, so, it prefers the more “timeless” pieces that it could wear every day without looking stale. It also wears a simple bracelet on the right hand. 

As previously commented, however, the ChibiPanda unit is pretty adept in acquisition and application of own clothing assembly. 


## Common Tasks and Procedures

This section will cover normal daily ritual and occurrences. This section will not cover privileged information such as work related information. 

### Waking Up

The ChibiPanda unit has short PER3 genes, and therefore is not very happy in the mornings. It prefers to wake up later and go to bed later. However, due to societal requirements, it normally wakes up at 0830 in the morning on weekdays with the aid of the alarm on the iPhone’s Clock application. The ChibiPanda unit will then roll out from under the comforter and run a quick Power On Self Test. 

### Hygiene and Grooming

Your ChibiPanda unit showers at night, since it has no time in the morning for this “jibbi jabba”. The ChibiPanda unit has strict hygiene regime. It washes its hair everyday, and will require separate shampoo and conditioner. Since it has dry hair, moisturising and reconstructing shampoo and conditioner with pH between 3.5 and 6 are preferred. Afterwards, the hair is normally brushed, and then air-dried. On occasions, the hair will be dried using the hair dryer, although this method is quite troublesome for the unit since it has to take the hair dryer out of the cabinet and plug it to the electrical outlet. The ChibiPanda unit insists on keeping its face free of any interference. It has fringes, but they are kept firmly out of the way using a beret clip. The hair in the back are kept in place by means of ponytail holder. 

The ChibiPanda unit showers on daily basis, and it requires a non-scented soap for this purpose. It prefers an anti-bacterial bar soap, but will accept liquid when required. It also uses the Sonicare Pro body brush to rid itself of dead skin cells. It uses the same bar of soap to wash its face, also utilising the Sonicare Pro brush to rid itself of dead skin cells on the face, albeit with a different brush head. When the weather is particularly dry, non-scented hypoallergenic lotion is then applied to the skin and face. For the underarm areas, non-scented hypoallergenic anti-perspirant is applied. 

After shower, the ChibiPanda unit will clean its ears using one cotton bud stick per ear. It will also clean its cartilage piercing at this point, followed by weighing of oneself. Teeth brushing and flossing are another daily routine. Flossing before brushing is the approach adopted. For flossing, it requires both waxed minted flossing strings and a waterpik unit. For optimal clean feeling, a length of flossing string will be used. However, there are occasions where time is of the essence, at which point, a waterpik will be used. For teeth brushing, it requires a sonic toothbrush with small head and sensitive-teeth-plus-whitening tooth paste. It prefers Crest, but will work with a different brand when needed. While brushing, the unit will also clean its tongue. After brushing, it will then use the mouthwash to rid itself of germs that are not eliminated by the flossing and brushing. 

The ChibiPanda unit prefers very short nails, both on the fingers and toes, since it has a rather obsessive compulsion to clean under the nails. The only exception to this preference is the pinky nails, since those are the nails used to pick debris and general manoeuvreing between small spaces. It is also obsessive about its facial pores, especially in the nose and chin area. It will sometimes be found to squeeze the pores to rid itself of blackheads. The shortness of the finger nails are especially helpful in this case. 

The ChibiPanda unit does not usually use makeup. This is caused by lack of time in the morning to apply makeup. Coupled with the fear of pore clogging and poking of its own eye from applying eyeliner, it decided that it will go au naturel every day. 

### Driving and Transportation

The ChibiPanda unit owns a personal vehicle, however, due to its lazy nature, it prefers to carpool to work. Carpooling implies the ability to sleep while the driving happens with minimal risk of accident. When pressed, it will drive itself to destination. 

The unit does not have any aversion toward public transportation, but dislike the waiting time in the bus and metro station. This, along with the fact that it owns a personal vehicle, causes it to prefer to drive itself where it needs to go. 

The unit prefers a 2-seat coupe when available. It is partial to lightweight car, and will probably go for the most power per weight value. It prefers rear wheel drive vehicle, and thus far has only driven front-engine vehicles. It is looking forward to the time when it will be driving a mid-engine vehicle and a rear-engine one. It currently owns a hatchback with pretty good manoeuvrability.. 

The ChibiPanda unit dislikes driving larger vehicle (e.g. SUV, minivans). This is caused by its difficulty with spatial perception. It is very bad at parking, and parking a larger car is a much more difficult task than a small vehicle. 

The unit does not have good balance and just quite recently learnt how to ride a bicycle, an accomplishment that it was quite proud of.  

### Nourishment

The ChibiPanda unit is almost constantly on diet. As far as nourishment is concerned, it has its own calculation on what it needs and how much it has had so far. It prefers almost-no-fat diet, low-carb, high-fibre, and high-protein diet. In general, in a day, approximately 65 grams of protein and 35 grams of fibre are consumed. The ChibiPanda unit tried its best to not ingest more than 1300 kilo calories a day. 

While preferring certain kind of nourishment, it also requires minimal effort on its part to prepare it. Therefore, it invents a lot of low-involvement dishes. Its particular favourite is microwave-made-egg-white omelette, consisting of a cup of egg white in a bowl being microwaved for 3 minutes. It will, afterwards, put a topping on top. Blue brie is a particular favourite, although toppings such as maple syrup, nutella, orange marmalade, and soy sauce have known to be used. 

The ChibiPanda unit will eat one piece of chocolate and one piece of cheese combined together every day. It prefers dark chocolate combined with one of the lighter tasting cheese. Of late, light Havaarti is a favourite. 


## Warnings

This section will cover advisable and non-advisable actions and their possible result. 

### Allergies

The ChibiPanda unit is allergic to dust and pollen. It is advised that flowers are not sent for any reason other than to provoke possible anaphylaxis. The unit usually takes antihistamine to withstand springs and summers. 

### Irritating Factors

This unit is highly volatile and irritable when hungry. Reading in a moving vehicle is headache inducing, and not well tolerated. When having headache, temper will be quite a bit shorter. In which case, it is advisable to not provoke any reactions. In general, it is quite easy to appease this unit by offering chocolate and/or cheese. 

The ChibiPanda unit is very peculiar about certain things. All of the clothing items that are hung in the closet has to face the same way, the front facing the left side. It is also best to leave the cereal on top of the refrigerator with the nutrition fact lists prominently displayed, and the bag inside be cut with a diagonal opening away from the side of the box with nutritional content. The unit finds it preferable for the kitchen sink to be kept clean, and general organic decomposable matter is found bothersome.

Fingerprints and smudges on the computer screen are particularly disturbing, although they are easily removed. This is the reason why matte screens are preferred to glossy ones. It also finds mold in the bathroom particularly repulsive. 

Loud and/or high pitched noise are particularly irritating. It finds that frequent use of the sentence filler like “like” irritating. It finds that to fill the silence, “Err”, “Hmm”, or “uhh” work better. It also finds the current trend of using random abbreviation, misspelling, and grammatical error in sentences irritating. Technology exists to assist with such tasks and shall be used to the full extent to avoid embarrassment. It appreciates highly precise, accurate instruction with unequivocal diction, since it avoids confusion and ambiguity. 

### Desk and Room

The ChibiPanda unit is quite unfussy about the state of the desk and bedroom. The unit finds no potential biological hazard in strewn-about clothings and papers on the bedroom floor and desk. The unit therefore will default to its lazy state. However, due to outside influence, the unit has put forth effort to keep bedroom floor clean and to keep desk clutter to a minimum, albeit a minimal amount of clutter is still present to provide comfort and familiarity. 

It is strongly advised that one steer clear of the desk and room unless allowed prior. 

### Other General Peculiarities

The ChibiPanda unit does not like the number 4, and it is particularly fond of the number 3. The colour purple is in general not very highly rated while red is an all time favourite in vehicle colour. In general, green is highly liked. 

This unit dislike vegetables, but will eat carrots, broccolis and cauliflower given that they are cooked until particularly soggy. This unit finds that crunchy cereal chafes its soft palate, and therefore prefers to wait for the cereal to gets soggy. Cold food are generally preferred to hot one.
